This is a long-term Python project created from scratch by me, Sathvik Mulukutla. Its main purpose is to demonstrate my skill with Python as a language and object-oriented programming as a whole.

To run the program:
1. Clone the repository to any directory on your computer
2. Install Python if not already installed
3. Download pygame from pip
4. Execute main.py
5. **Please note, the main branch is for Linux systems, while the Windows branch is for Windows systems. Clone as necessary.**

I accept any issues on this repo.

Have fun!
